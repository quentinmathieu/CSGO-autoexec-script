GitHub Copilot: # CSGO autoexec script
## A script that allows you to update your options and autoexec quickly

With the CSGO autoexec script, you can:

 - Search for your current game config and video settings
 - Quickly update various autoexecs
 - All without opening a file explorer

# How to use it?

You will need 2 things:

  * Your steamID3
    * if you don't know it, you can find it by entering your [steam name or profile number](http://steamcommunity.com/my/profile) on https://steamidfinder.com
    * OR if you only use one csgo account in your Steam\userdata\YourSteamID3 directory (on the contrary, if you have multiple accounts, I recommend option 1)
  * The location of csgo on your disk (steam library->right click on csgo->property->Local files->browse)
 
## The 2 scripts

After downloading the github, you will browse a folder with 3 files:
  * copy_from_730.bat which will be used to fetch your current csgo config as well as your video settings
  * setup.bat which will be used to update your settings as well as your autoexec
  * An autoexec file with basic settings, you are of course encouraged to customize it (and the name doesn't matter)
